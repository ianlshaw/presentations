# SSL Certificate 101

## What is it? What does it do?
##### An SSL Certificate is a digital certificate, used by a webserver to `validate` its own `identity` to any visting user.

##### It provides visiting users `proof` that the website, is indeed the website it `claims` to be.

## Product Types

### `DomainSSL`
### `OrganizationSSL`
### `ExtendedSSL`

##### DomainSSL
Come with the advantage of being issued almost immediately and without the need to submit company paperwork.

##### OrganizationalSSL
Companies applying for OrganizationSSL have their company details vetted before issuance.

##### ExtendedSSL
Activate the browser interface security enhancements, such as the Green Bar. For customers who wish to assert the highest levels of authenticity, ExtendedSSL is the ideal solution.

Requires paperwork at both our side, and the clients - longest lead time.


## SSL Certificate Type

### `Single Domain Certificate`
### `Wildcard SSL Certificate`

##### Single Domain Certificate
Secures a single Fully Qualified Domain Name such as www.globalsign.com or secure.globalsign.com

##### Wildcard SSL Certificate
Secures all sub-domains on a single Fully Qualified Domain Name. e.g. the Certificate is issued to *.globalsign.com

If at any point in the future, any subdomain other than www. will be used, then you should consider a wildcard certificate, to avoid having to buy another, seperate certificate.

## What happens if you don't buy this.
### Hackers can `steal` your users data.

##### `Anyone` on the `same network` as a user, can intercept `data submitted` to the site.

##### `Anyone` with `control over a network`, can direct users on `that network` attempting to go to your url, to `anywhere they want.`


##### Failure to buy and install an SSL certificate, means you have `absolutely no way` to prevent this.
